            BOSTON -- Angels general manager Perry Minasian met with the media early this week to discuss a wide variety
            of topics related to the start of the season.<br /><br />The Angels are off to a 7-5 start and are headed on
            an East Coast road trip against the Red Sox and Yankees. The bullpen fared much better in the club’s series
            win over the Nationals but was an area of concern after the Angels failed to protect three late leads over
            their first nine games.<br />Here are a few highlights of what Minasian had to say:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/angels-gm-perry-minasian-meets-with-media">Link<a/>

              allowed, two hit batters, a wild pitch, a run-scoring passed ball and going 1-for-14 with runners in
