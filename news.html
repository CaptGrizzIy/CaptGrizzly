                  BOSTON -- Angels general manager Perry Minasian met with the media early this week to discuss a wide
                  variety of topics related to the start of the season.<br /><br />The Angels are off to a 7-5 start and
                  are headed on an East Coast road trip against the Red Sox and Yankees. The bullpen fared much better
                  in the club’s series win over the Nationals but was an area of concern after the Angels failed to
                  protect three late leads over their first nine games.<br />Here are a few highlights of what Minasian
